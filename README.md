# myPhaserGame
my first phaser game


Hello there,

This is a game I created using Phaser's online game engine. The code is intended for their online code editor, Sandbox.
In the following code, please copy and paste each section into the Sandbox. I have separated the code into chunks that
divided with "///" symbols. The first section is the preload section. The second section is the create section. Finally, the
third section is the update section. These are the only sections that are needed.

Once copied properly, you should be able to hit "Play" in their Sandbox and everything should run, no set up necessary.


Here is the link for Sandbox:
